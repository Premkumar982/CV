CSS - "Display" property
1. block
2.inline
3.inline-block
4. none

<div class="">
  <img src="" alt="">
  <h1></h1>
  <p></p>
  <img src="" alt="">
  <img src="" alt="">
</div>
/*Above is the sample str*/

h1 & p tags is width of the page but not the others which is due to default
"display" property of the elements

 eg. block
 1. <p></p>, <h1></h1> etc.
 2. on its own it doesn't take width element as it takes the whole row
 3. It can take width properties and act accordingly but still it blocks the
 whole line

 eg. inline
 1. <span></span>, <img>, <a ></a>
 2. Inline elements doesn't take any width as it takes as much space an
 element is required


 Note: Display property can given to an element and can be made as block or
inline

PS: 1. Block element takes the whole line so it takes width property
but even if it is short it wont allow other elements in the line
 2. Inline elements accommodates as much elements (like <span>) so it
   doesn't take width property

"Inline-block" is the one which accommodates element's data also takes width
property to it.

 eg. Hybrid of block & inline (inline-block)
 1. Display element can be modified to any of the above elements
 2. In case of inline-block, width takes effect and everything falls inline

 PS: Note on section 5.43 on udemy (angela)
